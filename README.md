# PPGAnalyzer

## **Overview**

PPGAnalyzer is a project focused on exploring how Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals can be used to analyze Heart Rate Variability (HRV). This research-driven initiative investigates the relationship between HRV and stress, aiming to uncover insights that connect physiological data to health and wellness.

## **Motivation**

This project draws inspiration from:

- WHOOP's research on HRV and fitness tracking.
- Oura's innovations in wearable health monitoring.
- Peter Charlton's work on PPG datasets and signal analysis.
- EliteHRV's studies on HRV and its clinical importance.

## **Project Highlights**

1. **Understanding PPG and HRV**:

   - Analyzing how PPG signals can be processed to derive HRV metrics.
   - Exploring the implications of HRV changes on health and stress.

2. **Noise Management**:

   - Addressing challenges in PPG signal processing, including noise removal and artifact handling.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**:

   - Testing the relationship between HRV and stress using various datasets.
   - Observing trends in HRV through short signal windows (e.g., 10â€“30 seconds).

4. **Datasets**:
   - Leveraging publicly available datasets for PPG signal exploration and validation.
